# **📌 Spectra Render Engine**
*Ultra-High-Fidelity Render Engine for Still Images & Real-Time Rendering*

## 🚀 Part of a 9-month graphics programming challenge to develop an industry-grade rendering engine.

*📌 Developed by: [Prayas Bharadwaj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prayas-bharadwaj-053886323/)*

## 🌟 Overview
Spectra is a next-generation render engine designed for maximum quality rendering. It supports both real-time and software-based path-traced rendering, with an advanced material system, virtualized geometry, and a modular architecture.

## 💡 Core Features:

Hybrid Rendering: DX12 & Vulkan backend with seamless switching.
Ultra-High-Fidelity: Supports RTGI, PTGI, advanced materials, dynamic LOD, and high-performance shadows/reflections.
Modular Architecture: Uses DLL-based components for flexibility and scalability.
Powerful UI: ImGui-based custom UI toolkit with node-based material editing.
Drag & Drop Editor: Place meshes, tweak materials, and build scenes effortlessly.
